# Breast_Cancer_Autoencoder_Project
The data for this project was from Wang S, Lee D (2023) Identifying prognostic subgroups of luminal-A breast cancer using deep autoencoders and gene expressions. PLOS Computational Biology 19(5): e1011197. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011197
The purpose of this project is to recreate the published figures using available data. 
The provided code goes through:
- Data Preprocessing and Renormalization
- Autoencoder development
- K Means Clustering
- t-SNE plotting
- Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve Plotting

The code provided bby the orginal publication was referenced, https://github.com/BISLshwang/ISLA.
